Description: add and remove users and groups
 This package includes the 'adduser' and 'deluser' commands for creating
 and removing users.
 .
  - 'adduser' creates new users and groups and adds existing users to
    existing groups;
  - 'deluser' removes users and groups and removes users from a given
    group.
 .
 Adding users with 'adduser' is much easier than adding them manually.
 Adduser will choose appropriate UID and GID values, create a home
 directory, copy skeletal user configuration, and automate setting
 initial values for the user's password, real name and so on.
 .
 Deluser can back up and remove users' home directories
 and mail spool or all the files they own on the system.
 .
 A custom script can be executed after each of the commands.

Description: utility for unprivileged chroot and namespace manipulation
 bubblewrap uses Linux namespaces to launch unprivileged containers.
 These containers can be used to sandbox semi-trusted applications such
 as Flatpak apps, image/video thumbnailers and web browser components,
 or to run programs in a different library stack such as a Flatpak runtime
 or a different Debian release.
 .
 By default, this package relies on a kernel with user namespaces enabled.
 Official Debian and Ubuntu kernels are suitable.
 .
 On kernels without user namespaces, system administrators can make the
 bwrap executable setuid root, allowing it to create unprivileged
 containers even though ordinary user processes cannot.

Description: Informational list of build-essential packages
 If you do not plan to build Debian packages, you don't need this
 package.  Starting with dpkg (>= 1.14.18) this package is required
 for building Debian packages.
 .
 This package contains an informational list of packages which are
 considered essential for building Debian packages.  This package also
 depends on the packages on that list, to make it easy to have the
 build-essential packages installed.
 .
 If you have this package installed, you only need to install whatever
 a package specifies as its build-time dependencies to build the
 package.  Conversely, if you are determining what your package needs
 to build-depend on, you can always leave out the packages this
 package depends on.
 .
 This package is NOT the definition of what packages are
 build-essential; the real definition is in the Debian Policy Manual.
 This package contains merely an informational list, which is all
 most people need.   However, if this package and the manual disagree,
 the manual is correct.

Description: Tiny utilities for small and embedded systems
 BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
 small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for the most common
 utilities you would usually find on your desktop system (i.e., ls, cp, mv,
 mount, tar, etc.). The utilities in BusyBox generally have fewer options than
 their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the options that are included
 provide the expected functionality and behave very much like their GNU
 counterparts.
 .
 This package installs the BusyBox binary but does not install
 symlinks for any of the supported utilities. Some of the utilities
 can be used in the system by installing the busybox-syslogd,
 busybox-udhcpc or busybox-udhcpd packages.

Description: high-quality block-sorting file compressor - utilities
 bzip2 is a freely available, patent free, data compressor.
 .
 bzip2 compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler block-sorting text
 compression algorithm, and Huffman coding.  Compression is generally
 considerably better than that achieved by more conventional
 LZ77/LZ78-based compressors, and approaches the performance of the PPM
 family of statistical compressors.

 The archive file format of bzip2 (.bz2) is incompatible with that of its
 predecessor, bzip (.bz).

Description: process scheduling daemon
 The cron daemon is a background process that runs particular programs at
 particular times (for example, every minute, day, week, or month), as
 specified in a crontab. By default, users may also create crontabs of
 their own so that processes are run on their behalf.
 .
 Output from the commands is usually mailed to the system administrator
 (or to the user in question); you should probably install a mail system
 as well so that you can receive these messages.
 .
 This cron package does not provide any system maintenance tasks. Basic
 periodic maintenance tasks are provided by other packages, such
 as checksecurity.

Description: OpenPrinting CUPS Filters - cups-browsed
 This package provides cups-browsed, a daemon which browses the Bonjour
 broadcasts of shared remote CUPS printers and makes the printers
 available locally, replacing the CUPS broadcasting/browsing which was
 dropped in CUPS 1.6.x. This way the old behavior of having the remote
 printers available automatically is now re-implemented with Bonjour.
 .
 cups-browsed is also useful with a CUPS >= 1.6 client to allow the
 latter to browse the printer list of CUPS < 1.6 servers (by using the
 old 'cups' protocol in BrowseRemoteProtocols).

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (daemon and utilities)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 D-Bus supports broadcast messages, asynchronous messages (thus
 decreasing latency), authentication, and more. It is designed to be
 low-overhead; messages are sent using a binary protocol, not using
 XML. D-Bus also supports a method call mapping for its messages, but
 it is not required; this makes using the system quite simple.
 .
 It comes with several bindings, including GLib, Python, Qt and Java.
 .
 This package contains the D-Bus daemon and related utilities.
 .
 The client-side library can be found in the libdbus-1-3 package, as it is no
 longer contained in this package.

Description: simple interprocess messaging system (systemd --user integration)
 D-Bus is a message bus, used for sending messages between applications.
 Conceptually, it fits somewhere in between raw sockets and CORBA in
 terms of complexity.
 .
 On systemd systems, this package opts in to the session model in which
 a user's session starts the first time they log in, and does not end
 until all their login sessions have ended. This model merges all
 parallel non-graphical login sessions (text mode, ssh, cron, etc.), and up
 to one graphical session, into a single "user-session" or "super-session"
 within which all background D-Bus services are shared.
 .
 Multiple graphical sessions per user are not currently supported in this
 mode; as a result, it is particularly suitable for gdm, which responds to
 requests to open a parallel graphical session by switching to the existing
 graphical session and unlocking it.
 .
 To retain dbus' traditional session semantics, in which login sessions
 are artificially isolated from each other, remove this package and install
 dbus-x11 instead.
 .

Description: File comparison utilities
 The diffutils package provides the diff, diff3, sdiff, and cmp programs.
 .
 `diff' shows differences between two files, or each corresponding file
 in two directories.  `cmp' shows the offsets and line numbers where
 two files differ.  `cmp' can also show all the characters that
 differ between the two files, side by side.  `diff3' shows differences
 among three files.  `sdiff' merges two files interactively.
 .
 The set of differences produced by `diff' can be used to distribute
 updates to text files (such as program source code) to other people.
 This method is especially useful when the differences are small compared
 to the complete files.  Given `diff' output, the `patch' program can
 update, or "patch", a copy of the file.

 ISA) and memory module slots, and the list of I/O ports (e.g. serial, parallel,
 USB).
 .
 Beware that DMI data have proven to be too unreliable to be blindly trusted.
 Dmidecode does not scan the hardware, it only reports what the BIOS told it to.

 By default (and hence on installation) it creates swapfile twice as
 big as the present RAM amount with an upper limit of 2 GB.
 .
 It's also very helpful when included in SD card, USB stick or disk
 images which are distributed and run on many machines with different
 amount of RAM, e.g. different models of the Raspberry Pi or cloud
 images.

Description: Save/restore system clock on machines without working RTC hardware
 Some machines don't have a working realtime clock (RTC) unit, or no
 driver for the hardware that does exist. fake-hwclock is a simple set
 of scripts to save the kernel's current clock periodically (including
 at shutdown) and restore it at boot so that the system clock keeps at
 least close to realtime. This will stop some of the problems that may
 be caused by a system believing it has travelled in time back to
 1970, such as needing to perform filesystem checks at every boot.
 .
 On top of this, use of NTP is still recommended to deal with the fake
 clock "drifting" while the hardware is halted or rebooting.

Description: Identify, read, write, erase, and verify BIOS/ROM/flash chips
 flashrom is a tool for identifying, reading, writing, verifying and erasing
 flash chips. It's often used to flash BIOS/EFI/coreboot/firmware/optionROM
 images in-system using a supported mainboard, but it also supports flashing of
 network cards (NICs), SATA controller cards, and other external devices which
 can program flash chips.
 .
 It supports a wide range of DIP32, PLCC32, DIP8, SO8/SOIC8, TSOP32/40/48,
 and BGA chips, which use various protocols such as LPC, FWH, parallel
 flash, or SPI.
 .
 The tool can be used to flash BIOS/firmware images for example -- be it
 proprietary BIOS images or coreboot (previously known as LinuxBIOS) images.
 .
 It can also be used to read the current existing BIOS/firmware from a
 flash chip.

Description: generic font configuration library - support binaries
 Fontconfig is a font configuration and customization library, which
 does not depend on the X Window System. It is designed to locate
 fonts within the system and select them according to requirements
 specified by applications.
 .
 Fontconfig is not a rasterization library, nor does it impose a
 particular rasterization library on the application. The X-specific
 library 'Xft' uses fontconfig along with freetype to specify and
 rasterize fonts.
 .
 This package contains a program to maintain the fontconfig cache
 (fc-cache), a sample program to list installed fonts (fc-list), a program
 to test the matching rules (fc-match) and a program to dump the binary
 cache files in string form (fc-cat). It no longer makes fonts managed by defoma
 available to fontconfig applications.

Description: Vera font family derivate with additional characters
 DejaVu provides an expanded version of the Vera font family aiming for
 quality and broader Unicode coverage while retaining the original Vera
 style. DejaVu currently works towards conformance with the Multilingual
 European Standards (MES-1 and MES-2) for Unicode coverage. The DejaVu
 fonts provide serif, sans and monospaced variants.
 .

Description: Introspection data for some FreeDesktop components
 GObject Introspection is a project for providing machine readable
 introspection data of the API of C libraries. This introspection
 data can be used in several different use cases, for example
 automatic code generation for bindings, API verification and documentation
 generation.
 .
 GObject Introspection contains tools to generate and handle the
 introspection data.
 .
 This package contains small pieces of introspection data for the Cairo,
 FontConfig, FreeType, GL, and some XOrg libraries. They are
 distributed in this package temporarily, while the original sources
 do not include support for GObject Introspection. They are far from
 complete and only include what is necessary for other introspection
 packages to work properly.

 command line or in scripts.  Even if you don't want to use it, other packages
 on your system probably will.
 .
 The GNU family of grep utilities may be the "fastest grep in the west".
 GNU grep is based on a fast lazy-state deterministic matcher (about
 twice as fast as stock Unix egrep) hybridized with a Boyer-Moore-Gosper
 search for a fixed string that eliminates impossible text from being
 considered by the full regexp matcher without necessarily having to
 look at every character. The result is typically many times faster
 than Unix grep or egrep. (Regular expressions containing backreferencing
 will run more slowly, however.)

Description: GStreamer plugin for ALSA
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.
 .
 This package contains the GStreamer plugin for the ALSA library.  ALSA
 is the Advanced Linux Sound Architecture.

Description: GStreamer OpenMAX plugins
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.
 .
 This module provides a plugin that allows communication of GStreamer
 with OpenMAX IL components, which are used to access hardware
 encoders and decoders.

 GStreamer Bad Plug-ins is a set of plug-ins that aren't up to par compared
 to the rest. They might be close to being good quality, but they're missing
 something - be it a good code review, some documentation, a set of tests, a
 real live maintainer, or some actual wide use.

Description: GStreamer plugins from the "good" set
 GStreamer is a streaming media framework, based on graphs of filters
 which operate on media data.  Applications using this library can do
 anything from real-time sound processing to playing videos, and just
 about anything else media-related.  Its plugin-based architecture means
 that new data types or processing capabilities can be added simply by
 installing new plug-ins.
 .
 This package contains the GStreamer plugins from the "good" set, a set
 of good-quality plug-ins under the LGPL license.

Description: icon theme caching utility
 gtk-update-icon-cache creates mmap()able cache files for icon themes.
 .
 GTK can use the cache files created by gtk-update-icon-cache to avoid a lot
 of system call and disk seek overhead when the application starts. Since the
 format of the cache files allows them to be mmap()ed shared between multiple
 applications, the overall memory consumption is reduced as well.

Description: theme engines for GTK+ 2.x
 This package contains the "engines" that hide behind the themes for
 GTK+ and GNOME applications. They redefine the way GTK+ widgets are
 drawn. The package includes the following engines:
  * Clearlooks, the default GNOME theme, based on Bluecurve;
  * Crux, formerly known as the Eazel engine;
  * High contrast, which is used by some accessibility themes;
  * Industrial, the famous engine from Novell (formerly Ximian);
  * LighthouseBlue, another engine based on Bluecurve;
  * Metal, which gives a metallic look;
  * Mist, a flat and high performance engine;
  * Redmond95, which provides a look similar to that of Windows;
  * ThinIce.
 .
 A few sample themes using these engines are also included.

 printing on most HP SFP (single function peripheral) inkjets and many
 LaserJets, and for scanning, sending faxes and for photo-card access on
 most HP MFP (multi-function peripheral) printers.
 .
 HPLIP is composed of:
  * System services to handle communications with the printers
  * HP CUPS backend driver (hp:) with bi-directional communication with
    HP printers (provides printer status feedback to CUPS and enhanced
    HPIJS functionality such as 4-side full-bleed printing support)
  * HP CUPS backend driver for sending faxes (hpfax:)
  * hpcups CUPS Raster driver to turn rasterized input from the CUPS
    filter chain into the printer's native format (PCL, LIDIL, ...).
    (hpcups is shipped in a separate package)
  * HPIJS Ghostscript IJS driver to rasterize output from PostScript(tm)
    files or from any other input format supported by Ghostscript, and
    also for PostScript(tm) to fax conversion support
    (HPIJS is shipped in a separate package)
  * Command line utilities to perform printer maintenance, such as
    ink-level monitoring or pen cleaning and calibration
  * GUI and command line utility to download data from the photo card
    interfaces in MFP devices
  * GUI and command line utilities to interface with the fax functions
  * A GUI toolbox to access all these functions in a friendly way
  * HPAIO SANE backend (hpaio) for flatbed and Automatic Document Feeder
    (ADF) scanning using MFP devices
 .
 USB and JetDirect (network) devices are supported.

Description: User space provider drivers for libibverbs
 libibverbs is a library that allows userspace processes to use RDMA
 "verbs" as described in the InfiniBand Architecture Specification and
 the RDMA Protocol Verbs Specification.  iWARP ethernet NICs support
 RDMA over hardware-offloaded TCP/IP, while InfiniBand is a
 high-throughput, low-latency networking technology.  InfiniBand host
 channel adapters (HCAs) and iWARP NICs commonly support direct
 hardware access from userspace (kernel bypass), and libibverbs
 supports this when available.
 .
 An RDMA driver consists of a kernel portion and a user space portion.
 This package contains the user space verbs drivers:

Description: DHCP client for automatically obtaining an IP address
 This is the Internet Software Consortium's DHCP client.
 .
 Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a protocol like BOOTP
 (actually dhcpd includes much of the functionality of bootpd). It
 gives client machines "leases" for IP addresses and can
 automatically set their network configuration. If your machine
 depends on DHCP (especially likely if it's a workstation on a large
 network, or a laptop, or attached to a cable modem), keep this or
 another DHCP client installed.

 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library is a utility library to aid portable multimedia programming.
 It contains safe portable string functions, random number generators, data
 structures, additional mathematics functions, cryptography and multimedia
 related functionality (like enumerations for pixel and sample formats).
 It is not a library for code needed by both libavcodec and libavformat.
 The goal for this library is to be modular, small, efficient and useful.
 .
 This package contains the runtime files.

Description: Library for manipulating block devices
 libblockdev is a C library with GObject introspection support that can be used
 for doing low-level operations with block devices like setting up LVM, BTRFS,
 LUKS or MD RAID.
 .
 The library uses plugins (LVM, BTRFS,...) and serves as a thin wrapper around
 its plugins' functionality. All the plugins, however, can be used as
 standalone libraries. One of the core principles of libblockdev is that it is
 stateless from the storage configuration's perspective (e.g. it has no
 information about VGs when creating an LV).

 users have been limited to the POSIX C APIs for manipulating regular
 expressions, and while regex does provide these APIs, they do not
 represent the best way to use the library. For example regex can cope
 with wide character strings, or search and replace operations (in a
 manner analogous to either sed or perl), something that traditional C
 libraries can not do.

Description: Bauer stereophonic-to-binaural DSP library
 The Bauer stereophonic-to-binaural DSP (bs2b) is designed to improve
 headphone listening of stereo audio records.
 .
 Typical stereo recordings are made for listening with speakers.
 What's missing in headphones is the sound going from each channel
 to the opposite ear, arriving a short time later for the extra distance
 traveled, and with a bit of high frequency roll-off for the shadowing
 effect of the head. The time delay to the far ear should also be
 somewhat longer at low frequencies than at high frequencies. bs2b
 implements both of these ideas to transform stereophonic recordings
 for headphone listening.

Description: Cairo 2D vector graphics library
 Cairo is a multi-platform library providing anti-aliased
 vector-based rendering for multiple target backends. Paths consist
 of line segments and cubic splines and can be rendered at any width
 with various join and cap styles. All colors may be specified with
 optional translucence (opacity/alpha) and combined using the
 extended Porter/Duff compositing algebra as found in the X Render
 Extension.
 .
 Cairo exports a stateful rendering API similar in spirit to the path
 construction, text, and painting operators of PostScript, (with the
 significant addition of translucence in the imaging model). When
 complete, the API is intended to support the complete imaging model of
 PDF 1.4.

Description: Perl module for error/exception handling in an OO-ish way
 The Error module provides two interfaces.  Firstly "Error" provides a
 procedural interface to exception handling. Secondly "Error" is a base class
 for errors/exceptions that can either be thrown, for subsequent catch, or can
 simply be recorded.
 .
 Errors in the class "Error" should not be thrown directly, but the user
 should throw errors from a sub-class of "Error".
 .
 Warning: Using the "Error" module is no longer recommended due to the
 black-magical nature of its syntactic sugar, which often tends to break. Its
 maintainers have stopped actively writing code that uses it, and discourage
 people from doing so.
 .
 Recommended alternatives are Exception::Class (libexception-class-perl),
 Error::Exception (not packaged), TryCatch (libtrycatch-perl), and Try::Tiny
 (libtry-tiny-perl).

Description: tool for simulating superuser privileges - shared libraries
 fakeroot provides a fake "root environment" by means of LD_PRELOAD and
 SysV IPC (or TCP) trickery. It puts wrappers around getuid(), chown(),
 stat(), and other file-manipulation functions, so that unprivileged
 users can (for instance) populate .deb archives with root-owned files;
 various build tools use fakeroot for this by default.
 .
 This package contains the LD_PRELOAD libraries.

Description: Frame Streams (fstrm) library
 Frame Streams is a light weight, binary clean protocol that allows for the
 transport of arbitrarily encoded data payload sequences with minimal framing
 overhead -- just four bytes per data frame. Frame Streams does not specify an
 encoding format for data frames and can be used with any data serialization
 format that produces byte sequences, such as Protocol Buffers, XML, JSON,
 MessagePack, YAML, etc. Frame Streams can be used as both a streaming
 transport over a reliable byte stream socket (TCP sockets, TLS connections,
 AF_UNIX sockets, etc.) for data in motion as well as a file format for data
 at rest. A "Content Type" header identifies the type of payload being carried
 over an individual Frame Stream and allows cooperating programs to determine
 how to interpret a given sequence of data payloads.
 .
 This is the "fstrm" implementation of Frame Streams in C.

 syntax or state machine, it is being used with authorization from
 Silicon Graphics, Inc.  However, the authors make no claim that Mesa
 is in any way a compatible replacement for OpenGL or associated with
 Silicon Graphics, Inc.
 .
 This version of Mesa provides GLX and DRI capabilities: it is capable of
 both direct and indirect rendering.  For direct rendering, it can use DRI
 modules from the libgl1-mesa-dri package to accelerate drawing.
 .
 This package does not include the modules themselves: these can be found
 in the libgl1-mesa-dri package.

Description: Font rendering engine for Complex Scripts -- library
 Graphite is a system that can be used to create and use "smart fonts" capable
 of displaying writing systems with various complex behaviors, such as:
 contextual shaping, ligatures, reordering, split glyphs, bidirectionality,
 stacking diacritics and complex positioning.
 .
 This library was designed and developed by the NRSI (Non-Roman Script
 Initiative) within SIL International (www.sil.org) to act as a complement to
 other smart font rendering technologies with limited practical local
 extensibility. Its purpose is to help meet the needs of a very large number
 of "minority language" communities for local extensibility of complex script
 behaviors.
 .
 The behavior of the rendering engine for a given writing system is specified
 through extra tables added to a TrueType font.  These tables are generated by
 compiling a GDL (Graphite Description Language) source file into a font using
 grcompiler.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

Description: interpreter for the PostScript language and for PDF - common files
 GPL Ghostscript is used for PostScript/PDF preview and printing.
 Usually as a back-end to a program such as ghostview, it can display
 PostScript and PDF documents in an X11 environment.
 .
 This package provides common architecture-independent files needed by
 the GPL Ghostscript library.
 .
 By default, GPL Ghostscript uses a font from the fonts-droid package to
 approximate glyphs in PDFs for which the requested CJK TrueType font
 is missing.  If the fonts-droid package is not installed, these glyphs
 will be rendered as bullets.

Description: Shared libraries for GSM speech compressor
 This package contains runtime shared libraries for libgsm, an
 implementation of the European GSM 06.10 provisional standard for
 full-rate speech transcoding, prI-ETS 300 036, which uses RPE/LTP
 (residual pulse excitation/long term prediction) coding at 13 kbit/s.
 .
 GSM 06.10 compresses frames of 160 13-bit samples (8 kHz sampling
 rate, i.e. a frame rate of 50 Hz) into 260 bits; for compatibility
 with typical UNIX applications, this implementation turns frames of
 160 16-bit linear samples into 33-byte frames (1650 Bytes/s).
 The quality of the algorithm is good enough for reliable speaker
 recognition; even music often survives transcoding in recognizable
 form (given the bandwidth limitations of 8 kHz sampling rate).
 .
 The interfaces offered are a front end modelled after compress(1), and
 a library API.  Compression and decompression run faster than realtime
 on most SPARCstations.  The implementation has been verified against the
 ETSI standard test patterns.

Description: low level cryptographic library (public-key cryptos)
 Nettle is a cryptographic library that is designed to fit easily in more or
 less any context: In crypto toolkits for object-oriented languages (C++,
 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the asymmetric cryptographic algorithms, which,
 require the GNU multiple precision arithmetic library (libgmp) for
 their large integer computations.

 LaserJets, and for scanning, sending faxes and for photo-card access on
 most HP MFP (multi-function peripheral) printers.
 .
 Shared library that provides direct I/O for each process. Prior to
 hpmud, all I/O was serialized through hpiod, a monolithic I/O processor.
 The new hpmud direct I/O is faster. Hpmud supports parallel, USB and
 JetDirect connectivity.
 .
 With hpmud, HPLIP no longer has Linux specific libusb extensions. This
 means any UNIX/Linux derivative that supports libusb may work with
 HPLIP. A public HPLIP "C" API is exposed through hpmud. See hpmud.h
 for documentation. A Python wrapper for hpmud, called hpmudext, is also
 available.

 Implementation of IEC 61883, part 1 (CIP, plug registers, and CMP), part 2

 FireWire multimedia devices use IEC 61883 protocols.
 .
 The libiec61883 library provides a higher level API for streaming DV,
 MPEG-2 and audio over Linux IEEE 1394. This includes both reception and
 transmission. It uses the new "rawiso" API of libraw1394, which
 transparently provides mmap-ed DMA for efficient data transfer. It also
 represents the third generation of I/O technology for Linux 1394 for
 these media types thereby removing the complexities of additional kernel
 modules, /dev nodes, and procfs. It also consolidates features for plug
 control registers and connection management that previously existed in
 experimental form in an unreleased version of libavc1394.

Description: JavaScript's functional programming helper library
 Underscore is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides a lot
 of the functional programming support that you would expect in
 Prototype.js (or Ruby), but without extending any of the built-in
 JavaScript objects.  It's the tie to go along with jQuery's tux.
 .
 Underscore provides 60-odd functions that support both the usual
 functional suspects: map, select, invoke - as well as more specialized
 helpers: function binding, javascript templating, deep equality
 testing, and so on.  It delegates to built-in functions, if present, so
 modern browsers will use the native implementations of forEach, map,
 reduce, filter, every, some and indexOf.

 libmnl is a minimalistic user-space library oriented to Netlink developers.
 There are a lot of common tasks in parsing, validating, constructing of
 both the Netlink header and TLVs that are repetitive and easy to get wrong.
 This library aims to provide simple helpers that allows you to re-use code
 and to avoid re-inventing the wheel.
 .
 The main features of this library are:
 .
 Small: the shared library requires around 30KB for an x86-based computer.
 .
 Simple: this library avoids complexity and elaborated abstractions that
 tend to hide Netlink details.
 .
 Easy to use: the library simplifies the work for Netlink-wise developers.
 It provides functions to make socket handling, message building,
 validating, parsing and sequence tracking, easier.
 .
 Easy to re-use: you can use the library to build your own abstraction
 layer on top of this library.
 .
 Decoupling: the interdependency of the main bricks that compose the
 library is reduced, i.e. the library provides many helpers, but the
 programmer is not forced to use them.
 .
 This package contains the shared libraries needed to run programs that use
 the minimalistic Netlink communication library.

Description: MPEG1 and MPEG2 video decoder library
 libmpeg2 is a library which can decode MPEG1 and MPEG2 video streams.
 .
 The main features in libmpeg2 are:
 .
  * Conformance - libmpeg2 is able to decode all mpeg streams that conform to
    certain restrictions. For streams that follow these restrictions, libmpeg2
    is probably 100% conformant to the mpeg standards - and there's a pretty
    extensive test suite to check this.
 .
  * Speed - there has been huge efforts there, and libmpeg2 is probably the
    fastest library around for what it does.
 .
  * Portability - most of the code is written in C, and when platform-specific
    optimizations are used, there always is a generic C routine to fall back
    on.  This should be portable to all architectures - at least it is known
    people run this code on x86, ppc, sparc, arm and sh4.
 .
  * Reuseability - libmpeg2 is not intended to include any project-specific
    code, but it should still include enough features to be used by very
    diverse projects.
 .
 This package contains the libmpeg2 shared libraries.

 Python, Pike, ...), in applications like LSH or GNUPG, or even in kernel
 space.
 .
 It tries to solve a problem of providing a common set of cryptographic
 algorithms for higher-level applications by implementing a
 context-independent set of cryptographic algorithms. In that light, Nettle
 doesn't do any memory allocation or I/O, it simply provides the
 cryptographic algorithms for the application to use in any environment and
 in any way it needs.
 .
 This package contains the symmetric and one-way cryptographic
 algorithms. To avoid having this package depend on libgmp, the
 asymmetric cryptos reside in a separate library, libhogweed.

 opposed to the SI's 4-channel max (though it did have some provisions for 6
 channel, this was not 5.1, and was seemingly a "late" addition). OpenAL Soft
 does not support the Vorbis and MP3 extensions, however those were considered
 deprecated even in the SI. It does, though, support some of the newer
 extensions like AL_EXT_FLOAT32 and AL_EXT_MCFORMATS for multi-channel and
 floating-point formats, as well as ALC_EXT_EFX for environmental audio effects,
 and others.

Description: OpenPGM shared library
 OpenPGM is an open source implementation of the Pragmatic General Multicast
 (PGM) specification in RFC 3208 available at www.ietf.org. PGM is a reliable
 and scalable multicast protocol that enables receivers to detect loss,
 request retransmission of lost data, or notify an application of
 unrecoverable loss. PGM is a receiver-reliable protocol, which means the
 receiver is responsible for ensuring all data is received, absolving the
 sender of reception responsibility. PGM runs over a best effort datagram
 service, currently OpenPGM uses IP multicast but could be implemented above
 switched fabrics such as InfiniBand.
 .
 This is the runtime package for programs that use the OpenPGM library.

  * XPath 1.0 implementation for complex data-driven tree queries
  * Full Unicode support with Unicode interface variants and automatic
    encoding conversions.
 .
 This library is extremely portable and easy to integrate and use.

 Since pugixml has a DOM parser, it can't process XML documents that do
 not fit in memory; also the parser is a non-validating one, so if you
 need DTD or XML Schema validation, the library is not for you.

Description: runtime library for PDF transformation/inspection software
 QPDF is a program that can be used to linearize (web-optimize),
 encrypt (password-protect), decrypt, and inspect PDF files from the
 command-line.  It does these and other structural, content-preserving
 transformations on PDF files, reading a PDF file as input and
 creating a new one as output.  It also provides many useful
 capabilities to developers of PDF-producing software or for people
 who just want to look at the innards of a PDF file to learn more
 about how they work.
 .
 QPDF understands PDF files that use compressed object streams
 (supported by newer PDF applications) and can convert such files into
 those that can be read with older viewers.  It can also be used for
 checking PDF files for structural errors, inspecting stream contents,
 or extracting objects from PDF files.  QPDF is not PDF content
 creation or viewing software -- it does not have the capability to
 create PDF files from scratch or to display PDF files.
 .
 This package contains the qpdf runtime libraries required to run
 programs that link with the qpdf library.

Description: Library for managing RDMA connections
 librdmacm is a library that allows applications to set up reliable
 connected and unreliable datagram transfers when using RDMA adapters.
 It provides a transport-neutral interface in the sense that the same
 code can be used for both InfiniBand and iWARP adapters.  The
 interface is based on sockets, but adapted for queue pair (QP) based
 semantics: communication must use a specific RDMA device, and data
 transfers are message-based.
 .
 librdmacm only provides communication management (connection setup
 and tear-down) and works in conjunction with the verbs interface
 provided by libibverbs, which provides the interface used to actually
 transfer data.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

Description: Audio sample rate conversion library
 libsamplerate (aka Secret Rabbit Code) is a library for audio rate conversion.
 .
 libsamplerate currently provides three different sample rate conversion
 algorithms; zero order hold, linear interpolation and FIR filter interpolation
 (using filters derived from the mathematical SINC function). The first two
 algorithms (zero order hold and linear) are included for completeness and are
 not recommended for any application where high quality sample rate conversion
 is required. For the FIR/Sinc algorithm, three converters are provided;
 SRC_SINC_FASTEST, SRC_SINC_MEDIUM_QUALITY and SRC_SINC_BEST_QUALITY to allow a
 trade off between conversion speed and conversion quality.
 .
 libsamplerate is capable of downsampling to 1/256 of the original sample rate
 and upsampling to 256 times the original sample rate. It is also capable of
 time varying conversions for vary speed effects and synchronising of two
 unlocked sample rates.

Description: lightweight RDF syntax library
 Serd is a lightweight C library for RDF syntax which supports reading
 and writing Turtle and NTriples.
 .
 Serd is not intended to be a swiss-army knife of RDF syntax, but rather
 is suited to resource limited applications, or situations where a simple
 reader/writer with minimal dependencies is ideal (e.g. in LV2 hosts or
 plugins).
 .
 Serd is:
  * small: Serd is implemented in under 2500 lines1 of standard C code.
  * portable and dependency-free: Serd uses only the C standard library,
    and has no external dependencies, making it a lightweight dependency
    in every sense.
  * fast and lightweight: Serd (and the included serdi tool) can be used
    to stream abbreviated Turtle (unlike many other tools which can not
    stream since they must first build an internal model to abbreviate).
    In other words, Serd can re-serialise an unbounded amount of Turtle
    using a fixed amount of memory, preserving the abbreviations in the

 is an order of magnitude faster for most inputs, but the resulting
 compressed files are anywhere from 20% to 100% bigger. On a single core
 of a Core i7 processor in 64-bit mode, Snappy compresses at about 250
 MB/sec or more and decompresses at about 500 MB/sec or more.

 libsoup uses the Glib main loop and is designed to work well with GTK+
 applications.  This enables GNOME applications to access HTTP servers
 on the network in a completely asynchronous fashion, very similar to
 the GTK+ programming model (a synchronous operation mode is also
 supported for those who want it).
 .
 The GNOME support library is used for features which are important to
 GNOME apps, but which require GNOME-specific libraries that non-GNOME
 apps may not want to add dependencies on.
 .
 Features:
  * Both asynchronous (GMainLoop and callback-based) and synchronous APIs
  * Automatically caches connections
  * SSL Support using GnuTLS
  * Proxy support, including authentication and SSL tunneling
  * Client support for Digest, NTLM, and Basic authentication
  * Server support for Digest and Basic authentication
  * Basic client-side SOAP and XML-RPC support

Description: library for ambisonic encoding and decoding (runtime files)
 libspatialaudio is an open-source and cross-platform C++ library for Ambisonic
 encoding and decoding, filtering and binaural rendering. It is targeted to
 render High-Order Ambisonic (HOA) and VR/3D audio samples in multiple
 environments, from headphones to classic loudspeakers. Its binaural rendering
 can be used for classical 5.1/7.1 spatial channels as well as Ambisonics
 inputs.  It supports Higher Order Ambisonics (HOA) and ACN/SN3D Ambisonics
 audio streams following the Google spatial audio specification and the IETF
 codec Ambisonics specification.
 .
 The library allows you to encode, decode, rotate, zoom HOA Ambisonics audio
 streams up to the 3rd order. It can output to standard and custom loudspeakers
 arrays. To playback with headphones, the binauralizer applies an HRTF (either
 a SOFA file or the included MIT HRTF) to provide a spatial binaural rendering
 effect. The binauralization can also be used to render multichannels streams
 (5.1, 7.1...).

Description: library for serialising LV2 atoms to/from Turtle
 Sratom is a new C library for serialising LV2 atoms to/from Turtle.
 It is intended to be a full serialisation solution for LV2 atoms,
 allowing implementations to serialise binary atoms to strings and
 read them back again. This is particularly useful for saving plugin
 state, or implementing plugin control with network transparency.
 Sratom uses Serd and Sord to do the work, it is a small library
 implemented in a single source file, suitable for direct inclusion
 in projects if avoiding a dependency is desired.

Description: Snowball stemming algorithms for use in Information Retrieval
 Snowball provides access to efficient algorithms for calculating a
 "stemmed" form of a word.  This is a form with most of the common
 morphological endings removed; hopefully representing a common
 linguistic base form.  This is most useful in building search engines
 and information retrieval software; for example, a search with stemming
 enabled should be able to find a document containing "cycling" given the
 query "cycles".
 .
 Snowball provides algorithms for several (mainly European) languages.
 It also provides access to the classic Porter stemming algorithm for
 English: although this has been superseded by an improved algorithm, the
 original algorithm may be of interest to information retrieval
 researchers wishing to reproduce results of earlier experiments.

Description: FFmpeg library for audio resampling, rematrixing etc. - runtime files
 FFmpeg is the leading multimedia framework, able to decode, encode, transcode,
 mux, demux, stream, filter and play pretty much anything that humans and
 machines have created. It supports the most obscure ancient formats up to the
 cutting edge.
 .
 This library provides performs highly optimized audio resampling, rematrixing
 and sample format conversion operations.
 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Resampling is the process of changing the audio rate, for example from a
    high sample rate of 44100Hz to 8000Hz. Audio conversion from high to low
    sample rate is a lossy process. Several resampling options and algorithms
    are available.
  * Rematrixing is the process of changing the channel layout, for example from
    stereo to mono. When the input channels cannot be mapped to the output
    streams, the process is lossy, since it involves different gain factors
    and mixing. Various other audio conversions (e.g. stretching and padding)
    are enabled through dedicated options.
  * Format conversion is the process of converting the type of samples, for
    example from 16-bit signed samples to unsigned 8-bit or float samples.
    It also handles packing conversion, when passing from packed layout (all
    samples belonging to distinct channels interleaved in the same buffer), to
    planar layout (all samples belonging to the same channel stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane").

 .
 This library performs highly optimized image scaling and colorspace and pixel

 Specifically, this library performs the following conversions:
  * Rescaling is the process of changing the video size. Several rescaling
    options and algorithms are available. This is usually a lossy process.
  * Pixel format conversion is the process of converting the image format and
    colorspace of the image, for example from planar YUV420P to RGB24 packed.
    It also handles packing conversion, that is converts from packed layout
    (all pixels belonging to distinct planes interleaved in the same buffer),
    to planar layout (all samples belonging to the same plane stored in a
    dedicated buffer or "plane"). This is usually a lossy process in case the
    source and destination colorspaces differ.

 The live555.com streaming media code is a set of C++ libraries for multimedia
 streaming, using open standard protocols (RTP/RTCP, RTSP, SIP). These
 libraries can be used to build applications to stream, receive and process
 MPEG, H.263+ or JPEG video, several audio codecs, and can easily be extended
 to support additional codecs. They can also be used to build basic RTSP (Real
 Time Streaming Protocol) or SIP (Session Initiation Protocol) clients and
 servers.
 .
 This package contains the UsageEnvironment library. The "UsageEnvironment" and
 "TaskScheduler" classes are used for scheduling deferred events, for assigning
 handlers for asynchronous read events, and for outputting error/warning
 messages. Also, the "HashTable" class defines the interface to a generic hash
 table, used by the rest of the code.
 .
 These are all abstract base classes; they must be subclassed for use in an
 implementation. These subclasses can exploit the particular properties of the
 environment in which the program will run - e.g., its GUI and/or scripting
 environment.

 libv4l1 offers the (deprecated) v4l1 API on top of v4l2 devices, independent
 of the drivers for those devices supporting v4l1 compatibility (which many
 v4l2 drivers do not).

 Many applications can use VDPAU to accelerate portions of the video

 hardware. Unfortunately, there is no such library for many graphic
 chipsets. Some applications also support VA-API but many of them,
 including Adobe Flash Player, don't.

Description: video stabilization library (shared library)
 Imagine you captured a nice video with your camcorder, compact camera or
 even cell phone while skiing, cycling or whatever sports and the video is
 basically just jiggled.
 .
 Modern cameras come along with hardware stabilisation, however this does
 not work if you have really strong vibrations - rather the contrary -
 sometimes this mechanism starts to oscillate.
 .
 Vid.Stab is your friend in this matter. It is designed to stabilize even
 strongly jiggled clips.
 .
 This package contains the shared library.

Description: audio visualization framework
 Libvisual is a generic visualization framework that allows applications
 to easily access and manage visualization plugins.
 .
 Audio visualization is the process of making pretty moving images that
 are correlated in some way to the audio currently being played by a media
 player. Most audio visualization is tied to a specific application or media
 player, making it difficult to share code. Libvisual allows applications
 to use existing visualization plugins written for the libvisual framework.
 .
 This package provides the runtime libraries for libvisual. Libvisual is not
 very useful without visualization plugins, so it is highly recommended to
 install the libvisual-0.4-plugins package.

Description: utility libraries for X C Binding -- atom, aux and event
 This package contains the library files needed to run software using
 libxcb-util.
 .
 The xcb-util module provides a number of libraries which sit on top of
 libxcb, the core X protocol library, and some of the extension
 libraries. These experimental libraries provide convenience functions
 and interfaces which make the raw X protocol more usable. Some of the
 libraries also provide client-side code which is not strictly part of
 the X protocol but which have traditionally been provided by Xlib.

 Xcursor is a simple library designed to help locate and load cursors for the
 X Window System.  Cursors can be loaded from files or memory and can exist in
 several sizes; the library automatically picks the best size.  When using
 images loaded from files, Xcursor prefers to use the Render extension's
 CreateCursor request for rendering cursors.  Where the Render extension is
 not supported, Xcursor maps the cursor image to a standard X cursor and uses
 the core X protocol CreateCursor request.
 .
 Preferred themes for cursors can be installed if desired, via
 xcursor-themes or other cursor-theme or icon-theme packages,
 configured with update-alternatives --config x-cursor-theme.

Description: X Rendering Extension client library
 The X Rendering Extension (Render) introduces digital image composition as
 the foundation of a new rendering model within the X Window System.
 Rendering geometric figures is accomplished by client-side tessellation into
 either triangles or trapezoids.  Text is drawn by loading glyphs into the
 server and rendering sets of them.  The Xrender library exposes this
 extension to X clients.

Description: Vertical Blanking Interval decoder (VBI) - common files
 The vertical blanking interval (VBI) is an interval in a television signal
 that temporarily suspends transmission of the signal for the electron gun
 to move back up to the first line of the television screen to trace the
 next screen field.
 .
 The vertical blanking interval can be used to carry data, since anything
 sent during the VBI would naturally not be displayed; various test signals,
 closed captioning, and other digital data can be sent during this time
 period. These include information like closed-caption data, Teletext
 (primarily in Europe), and now Intercast and the ATVEC Internet television
 encodings.
 .
 The Zapping VBI library, in short ZVBI, provides functions to capture and
 decode VBI data. It is written in plain ANSI C with few dependencies on
 other tools and libraries, licensed under GPL. Some features:
   * Captures raw VBI samples from V4L, V4L2 and FreeBSD BKTR devices, sliced
     VBI data from Linux DVB devices;
   * Implements a VBI Proxy to share one VBI device between multiple
     applications;
   * Has a robust and versatile bit slicer which handles a wide range of data
     services;
   * Functions to capture multiple data services at once, such as Closed
     Caption (both NTSC and PAL), Teletext, VPS, WSS, XDS;
   * Level 3.5 Teletext decoder with support for all Teletext character sets,
     graphics, 4096 colors, with built-in page cache including search
     functions;
   * Closed Caption decoder which supports roll-up, pop-up and paint-on style
     caption, color, expanded character set, text attributes and free text
     placement;
   * Renders Teletext and Caption pages, can export to HTML, PNG and other
     formats.
   * Can determine network names;
   * Can find Teletext subtitle and program pages;
   * Functions to extract data transmissions in Teletext streams (currently
     Page Format Clear and Independent Data Line Format A);
   * Can multiplex and demultiplex DVB VBI PES and TS streams.

Description: LXDE monitor configuration tool
 LXRandR is a GUI application for the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment
 (LXDE).
 .
 This is a very basic monitor config tool utilizing the X extension called
 RandR. It can let you change the screen resolution on the fly. Besides, when
 you run lxrandr with external monitor connected, its GUI will change, and show
 you some quick options to get your projector or external monitor working
 correctly.
 .
 This tool doesn't aim to be a full randr frontend. If you need the full power
 of RandR, get xrandr (console) or grandr (GUI) and read some tutorials.
 .
 LXRandR only gives you some easy and quick options which are intuitive. It's
 very suitable for laptop users who frequently uses projectors or external
 monitor and just want to get their work done without reading a lot of
 "geek-centered" manuals or command line tutorials.

Description: Pattern scanning and text processing language
 Mawk is an interpreter for the AWK Programming Language. The AWK
 language is useful for manipulation of data files, text retrieval and
 processing, and for prototyping and experimenting with algorithms. Mawk
 is a new awk meaning it implements the AWK language as defined in Aho,
 Kernighan and Weinberger, The AWK Programming Language, Addison-Wesley
 Publishing, 1988. (Hereafter referred to as the AWK book.) Mawk conforms
 to the POSIX 1003.2 (draft 11.3) definition of the AWK language
 which contains a few features not described in the AWK book, and mawk
 provides a small number of extensions.
 .
 Mawk is smaller and much faster than gawk. It has some compile-time
 limits such as NF = 32767 and sprintf buffer = 1020.

 /etc/skel/.mkshrc c0b4458282f77468ef70a1dee5bc694b
Description: MirBSD Korn Shell
 mksh is the successor of the Public Domain Korn shell (pdksh),
 a Bourne/POSIX compatible shell which is largely similar to the
 original AT&T Korn Shell (ksh88/ksh93).
 It includes bug fixes and feature improvements, in order to produce a
 modern, robust shell good for interactive and especially script use.
 mksh has UTF-8 support (in string operations and the Emacs editing
 mode). The code has been cleaned up and simplified, bugs fixed,
 standards compliance added, and several enhancements (for extended
 compatibility to other modern shells, as well as a couple of its
 own) are available.
 This shell is Debian Policy 10.4 compliant and works as /bin/sh on
 Debian systems (use the /bin/lksh executable) and is a good rescue
 and initrd shell (consider the /bin/mksh-static executable).
 .
 The mksh binary is a complete, full-featured shell. It provides a
 ‚Äúconsistent across all platforms‚Äù guarantee, using 32-bit integers
 for arithmetics, possibly deviating from POSIX.
 .
 The mksh-static binary is a version of mksh, linked against klibc,
 musl, or dietlibc (if they exist for that Debian architecture and
 are usable) and optimised for small code size, for example for use
 on initrd or initramfs images, installation or rescue systems.
 Except for omitting some features to be smaller, it is similar to
 the mksh binary otherwise. Note the exact feature set may differ
 depending on which C library was used to compile it.
 .
 The lksh binary is a script shell based on mksh intended to run old
 ksh88 and pdksh scripts, but not for interactive use. When used as
 /bin/sh it follows POSIX most closely, including use of the host‚Äôs
 ‚Äúlong‚Äù C data type for arithmetics. It also contains kludges so it
 can run as /bin/sh on Debian beyond what Policy dictates, to work
 around bugs in maintainer scripts and LSB init scripts shipped by
 many packages, such as including a rudimentary printf(1) builtin,
 permitting a shell function to be named stop overriding the default
 alias, more loose interpretation of shell extglobs, etc.
 .
 A sample ~/.mkshrc is included in /usr/share/doc/mksh/examples and
 provided as /etc/mkshrc conffile, which is sourced by another file
 /etc/skel/.mkshrc users are recommended to copy into their home.

Description: standards-compliant, fast, light-weight and extensible window manager
 Openbox works with your applications, and makes your desktop easier to manage.
 This is because the approach to its development was the opposite of what seems
 to be the general case for window managers. Openbox was written first to
 comply with standards and to work properly. Only when that was in place did
 the team turn to the visual interface.
 .
 Openbox is fully functional as a stand-alone working environment, or can be
 used as a drop-in replacement for the default window manager in the GNOME or
 KDE desktop environments.
 .
 Openbox 3 is a completely new breed of window manager. It is not based upon
 any existing code base, although the visual appearance has been based upon
 that of Blackbox. Openbox 2 was based on the Blackbox 0.65.0 codebase.
 .
 Some of the things to look for in Openbox are:
 .
  * ICCCM and EWMH compliance!
  * Very fast
  * Chainable key bindings
  * Customizable mouse actions
  * Window resistance
  * Multi-head Xinerama support!
  * Pipe menus

Description: LXDE session manager and configuration files
 LXDE (the Lightweight X11 Desktop Environment) is a project aimed
 to provide a desktop environment which is lightweight and fast.
 .
 It's not designed to be powerful and bloated, but to be usable and slim
 enough, and keep the resource usage low. Different from other desktop
 environments, LXDE doesn't tightly integrate every component. Instead,
 LXDE tries to make all components independent, and each of them can be
 used independently with fewer dependencies.
 .
 Features:
 .
  * Lightweight, runs with reasonable memory usage
  * Fast, runs well even on older machines produced in 1999
  * Good-looking, GTK+ 2 internationalized user interface
  * Easy-to-use, the user interface is simple, but usable enough
  * Desktop independent (surprise! Every component can be used without LXDE)
  * Standard compliant, follows the specs on freedesktop.org
 .
 This package depends on minimal set of components (lxsession, openbox,
 and lxde-screenlock.desktop file), and contains all the session-specific
 configuration files required to start a LXDE desktop session from a
 display manager such as GDM.

Description: secure shell (SSH) client, for secure access to remote machines
 This is the portable version of OpenSSH, a free implementation of
 the Secure Shell protocol as specified by the IETF secsh working
 group.
 .
 Ssh (Secure Shell) is a program for logging into a remote machine
 and for executing commands on a remote machine.
 It provides secure encrypted communications between two untrusted
 hosts over an insecure network. X11 connections and arbitrary TCP/IP
 ports can also be forwarded over the secure channel.
 It can be used to provide applications with a secure communication
 channel.
 .
 This package provides the ssh, scp and sftp clients, the ssh-agent
 and ssh-add programs to make public key authentication more convenient,
 and the ssh-keygen, ssh-keyscan, ssh-copy-id and ssh-argv0 utilities.
 .
 In some countries it may be illegal to use any encryption at all
 without a special permit.
 .
 ssh replaces the insecure rsh, rcp and rlogin programs, which are
 obsolete for most purposes.

Description: disk partition manipulator
 GNU Parted is a program that allows you to create, destroy, resize,

 for new operating systems, reorganizing disk usage, and copying data
 to new hard disks.
 .
 This package contains the binary and manual page. Further
 documentation is available in parted-doc.
 .
 Parted currently supports DOS, Mac, Sun, BSD, GPT, MIPS, and PC98
 partitioning formats, as well as a "loop" (raw disk) type which
 allows use on RAID/LVM. It can detect and remove ASFS/AFFS/APFS,
 Btrfs, ext2/3/4, FAT16/32, HFS, JFS, linux-swap, UFS, XFS, and ZFS
 file systems. Parted also has the ability to create and modify file
 systems of some of these types, but using it to perform file system
 operations is now deprecated.
 .
 The nature of this software means that any bugs could cause massive
 data loss. While there are no such bugs known at the moment, they
 could exist, so please back up all important files before running
 it, and do so at your own risk.

Description: Larry Wall's Practical Extraction and Report Language
 Perl is a highly capable, feature-rich programming language with over
 20 years of development. Perl 5 runs on over 100 platforms from
 portables to mainframes. Perl is suitable for both rapid prototyping
 and large scale development projects.
 .
 Perl 5 supports many programming styles, including procedural,
 functional, and object-oriented. In addition to this, it is supported
 by an ever-growing collection of reusable modules which accelerate
 development. Some of these modules include Web frameworks, database
 integration, networking protocols, and encryption. Perl provides
 interfaces to C and C++ for custom extension development.

Description: curses-based PIN or pass-phrase entry dialog for GnuPG
 This package contains a program that allows for secure entry of PINs or
 pass phrases.  That means it tries to take care that the entered
 information is not swapped to disk or temporarily stored anywhere.
 This functionality is particularly useful for entering pass phrases
 when using encryption software such as GnuPG or e-mail clients using
 the same.  It uses an open protocol and is therefore not tied to
 particular software.
 .
 The program contained in this package implements a PIN entry dialog
 using the curses tool kit, meaning that it is useful for users
 working in text mode without the X Window System.  There are sibling
 packages that implement PIN entry dialogs that use an X tool kit.  If
 you install any of the graphical packages then this package is not
 necessary because the sibling packages automatically fall back to
 text mode if X is not active.

Description: PulseAudio sound server
 PulseAudio, previously known as Polypaudio, is a sound server for POSIX and
 WIN32 systems. It is a drop in replacement for the ESD sound server with
 much better latency, mixing/re-sampling quality and overall architecture.
 .
 These are some of PulseAudio's features:
 .
   * High quality software mixing of multiple audio streams with support for
     more than one sink/source. May be used to combine multiple sound cards
     into one (with sample rate adjustment).
 .
   * Wide range of supported client libraries. ESD, ALSA, oss, libao and
     GStreamer client applications are supported as-is. Native PulseAudio
     plug-ins are also available for xmms and mplayer.
 .
   * Good low latency behaviour and very accurate latency measurement for
     playback and recording. Ability to fully synchronize multiple playback
     streams.
 .
   * Network transparency, allowing an application to play back or record
     audio on a different machine than the one it is running on.
 .
   * Extensible plug-in architecture with plug-ins for jackd, multicast-rtp
     lirc and avahi, just to name a few.
 .
 This package contains the daemon and basic module set.

 Pylint is a Python source code analyzer which looks for programming
 errors, helps enforcing a coding standard and sniffs for some code
 smells (as defined in Martin Fowler's Refactoring book)
 .
 Pylint can be seen as another PyChecker since nearly all tests you
 can do with PyChecker can also be done with Pylint. However, Pylint
 offers some more features, like checking length of lines of code,
 checking if variable names are well-formed according to your coding
 standard, or checking if declared interfaces are truly implemented,
 and much more.
 .
 Additionally, it is possible to write plugins to add your own checks.
 .
 The package also ships the following additional commands:
 .
   * pyreverse3: an UML diagram generator
   * symilar3: an independent similarities checker
   * epylint3: Emacs and Flymake compatible Pylint

Description: fast alternative implementation of Python - PyPy interpreter
 PyPy is a fast, compliant alternative implementation of the Python language
 (2.7). It has several advantages and distinct features:
  * Speed: thanks to its Just-in-Time compiler (on x86), Python programs often
    run faster on PyPy.
  * Memory usage: large, memory-hungry Python programs might end up taking less
    space than they do in CPython.
  * Compatibility: PyPy is highly compatible with existing Python code.
    It supports ctypes and can run popular Python libraries like twisted and
    django.
  * Stackless: PyPy supports stackless mode on most platforms, providing
    micro-threads for massive concurrency.

Description: rebuild a new abstract syntax tree from Python's AST (Python3)
 The aim of this module is to provide a common base representation of
 Python source code for projects such as pychecker, pyreverse,
 pylint... Well, actually the development of this library is essentially
 governed by pylint's needs. It used to be called logilab-astng.
 .
 It provides a compatible representation which comes from the `_ast`
 module.  It rebuilds the tree generated by the builtin _ast module by
 recursively walking down the AST and building an extended ast. The new
 node classes have additional methods and attributes for different
 usages.  They include some support for static inference and local name
 scopes.  Furthermore, astroid builds partial trees by inspecting living
 objects.
 .
 Main modules are:
 .
   * `bases`, `node_classses` and `scoped_nodes` contain the classes for the
     different type of nodes of the tree.
 .
   * the `manager` contains a high level object to get astroid trees from
     source files and living objects. It maintains a cache of previously
     constructed tree for quick access.
 .
 python3-astroid is the new name of former python3-logilab-astng library.

 The aim of this project is to provide a convenient and reliable way of calling
 C code from Python. It keeps Python logic in Python, and minimises the C
 required. It is able to work at either the C API or ABI level, unlike most
 other approaches, that only support the ABI level.

 that colors are tuples and thus immutable. Standard mathematical operators
 (addition, subtraction, multiplication, etc.) are used to generate new
 colors. Conversions are provided for a wide variety of systems including
 YUV, RGB565, CMYK, CIE Lab, and so on.

Description: small but fast and easy to use stand-alone template engine
 Jinja2 is a template engine written in pure Python. It provides a Django

 sandboxed environment.
 .
 The key-features are:
  * Configurable syntax. If you are generating LaTeX or other formats with
    Jinja2 you can change the delimiters to something that integrates better
    into the LaTeX markup.
  * Fast. While performance is not the primarily target of Jinja2 it‚Äôs
    surprisingly fast. The overhead compared to regular Python code was reduced
    to the very minimum.
  * Easy to debug. Jinja2 integrates directly into the Python traceback system
    which allows you to debug Jinja2 templates with regular Python debugging
    helpers.
  * Secure. It‚Äôs possible to evaluate untrusted template code if the optional
    sandbox is enabled. This allows Jinja2 to be used as templating language
    for applications where users may modify the template design.

Description: Python 3 fast and thorough lazy object proxy
 A lazy object proxy is an object that wraps a callable but defers the call
 until the object is actually required, and caches the result of said call.
 .
 These kinds of objects are useful in resolving various dependency issues, few
 examples:
 .
  * Objects that need to held circular references at each other, but at
    different stages. To instantiate object Foo you need an instance of Bar.
    Instance of Bar needs an instance of Foo in some of it methods (but not at
    construction).  Circular imports sound familiar?
 .
  * Performance sensitive code. You don't know ahead of time what you're going
    to use but you don't want to pay for allocating all the resources at the
    start as you usually need just few of them.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3 version of lazy-object-proxy .

Description: Python parser that supports error recovery - Python 3.X
 Parso is a Python parser that supports error recovery and round-trip parsing
 for different Python versions (in multiple Python versions). Parso is also able
 to list multiple syntax errors in your Python file.
 .
 Parso has been battle-tested by jedi. It was pulled out of jedi to be useful
 for other projects as well.
 .
 Parso consists of a small API to parse Python and analyse the syntax tree.
 .
 A simple example:
 .
  >>> import parso
  >>> module = parso.parse('hello + 1', version="3.6")
  >>> expr = module.children[0]
  >>> expr
  PythonNode(arith_expr, [<Name: hello@1,0>, <Operator: +>, <Number: 1>])
  >>> print(expr.get_code())
  hello + 1
  >>> name = expr.children[0]
  >>> name
  <Name: hello@1,0>
  >>> name.end_pos
  (1, 5)
  >>> expr.end_pos
  (1, 9)
 .
 To list multiple issues:
 .
  >>> grammar = parso.load_grammar()
  >>> module = grammar.parse('foo +\nbar\ncontinue')
  >>> error1, error2 = grammar.iter_errors(module)
  >>> error1.message
  'SyntaxError: invalid syntax'
  >>> error2.message
  "SyntaxError: 'continue' not properly in loop"

Description: Run a subprocess in a pseudo terminal from Python 3
 Launch a subprocess in a pseudo terminal (pty), and interact with both
 the process and its pty.
 .
 Sometimes, piping stdin and stdout is not enough. There might be a password
 prompt that doesn't read from stdin, output that changes when it's going to
 a pipe rather than a terminal, or curses-style interfaces that rely on a
 terminal. If you need to automate these things, running the process in a
 pseudo terminal (pty) is the answer.
 .

Description: Backported and Experimental Type Hints for Python
 The typing module was added to the standard library in Python 3.5 on a
 provisional basis and will no longer be provisional in Python 3.7. However,
 this means users of Python 3.5 - 3.6 who are unable to upgrade will not be
 able to take advantage of new types added to the typing module, such as
 typing.Text or typing.Coroutine.
 .
 The typing_extensions module contains both backports of these changes as well
 as experimental types that will eventually be added to the typing module, such
 as Protocol.
 .
 Users of other Python versions should continue to install and use the typing
 module from PyPI instead of using this one unless specifically writing code
 that must be compatible with multiple Python versions or requires experimental
 types.

Description: Python implementation of the WHATWG Encoding standard
 In order to be compatible with legacy web content when interpreting something
 like Content-Type: text/html; charset=latin1, tools need to use a particular
 set of aliases for encoding labels as well as some overriding rules.  For
 example, US-ASCII and iso-8859-1 on the web are actually aliases for
 windows-1252, and an UTF-8 or UTF-16 BOM takes precedence over any other
 encoding declaration.  The Encoding standard defines all such details so that
 implementations do not have to reverse-engineer each other.
 .
 This module has encoding labels and BOM detection, but the actual
 implementation for encoders and decoders is Python‚Äôs.
 .
 This package provides the module for Python 3.

Description: decorators, wrappers and monkey patching. - Python 3.x
 The aim of the wrapt module is to provide a transparent object proxy for
 Python, which can be used as the basis for the construction of function
 wrappers and decorator functions.
 .
 The wrapt module focuses very much on correctness. It therefore goes way
 beyond existing mechanisms such as functools.wraps() to ensure that decorators
 preserve introspectability, signatures, type checking abilities etc. The
 decorators that can be constructed using this module will work in far more
 scenarios than typical decorators and provide more predictable and consistent
 behaviour.
 .
 To ensure that the overhead is as minimal as possible, a C extension module is
 used for performance critical components. An automatic fallback to a pure
 Python implementation is also provided where a target system does not have a
 compiler to allow the C extension to be compiled.
 .
 This package contains the Python 3.x module.

 get-edid uses a VESA VBE 2 interrupt service routine request to read
 a 128 byte EDID version 1 structure from your graphics card, which
 retrieves this information from the monitor via the Data Display
 Channel (DDC).
 .
 get-edid uses architecture-specific methods for querying the video
 hardware (real-mode x86 instructions on i386, Open Firmware device
 tree parsing on PowerMac) and is therefore only available for i386 and
 powerpc architectures.
 .
 parse-edid parses this data structure and outputs data suitable for
 inclusion into the XFree86 or X.org configuration file. It is available
 for any architecture.

Description: daemon to use a Hardware RNG (classic version)
 The rngd daemon acts as a bridge between a Hardware RNG (random
 number generator), such as the ones in some Intel/AMD/VIA chipsets,
 and the kernel‚Äôs PRNG (pseudo-random number generator).
 .
 It tests the data received from the HWRNG using the FIPS 140-2 (2002-10-10)
 tests to verify that it is indeed random then feeds the random data to the
 kernel entropy pool.
 .
 This increases the bandwidth of the /dev/random device, from a source
 that does not depend on outside activity. It may also improve the
 quality (entropy) of the randomness of /dev/random.
 .
 An HWRNG kernel module such as hw_random, or some other source of true
 entropy that is accessible as a device or fifo, is required to use this
 package. Securely tunneling entropy over the network and feeding it to
 rngd is also possible.
 .
 This is an unofficial version of rng-tools (as classically shipped by
 Debian up to and including release 10 ‚Äúbuster‚Äù), version 2, extensively
 modified to add multithreading and a lot of new functionality. However,
 most users of newer or high-bandwidth HWRNGs might wish to install the
 latest version of upstream rng-tools (packaged as rng-tools5) instead;
 that package offers more performant support for those, even if it lacks
 the new functionality from this version.

 strace is a system call tracer: i.e. a debugging tool which prints out
 a trace of all the system calls made by another process/program.
 The program to be traced need not be recompiled for this, so you can
 use it on binaries for which you don't have source.
 .
 System calls and signals are events that happen at the user/kernel
 interface. A close examination of this boundary is very useful for bug
 isolation, sanity checking and attempting to capture race conditions.

Description: virtual network computing server software
 VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing. It is, in essence, a remote
 display system which allows you to view a computing `desktop' environment
 not only on the machine where it is running, but from anywhere on the
 Internet and from a wide variety of machine architectures.
 .
 This package provides a server to which X clients can connect and the
 server generates a display that can be viewed with a vncviewer.
 .
 The difference between the tightvncserver and the normal vncserver is the
 data encoding, optimized for low bandwidth connections. If the client do not
 support jpeg or zlib encoding it can use the default one. Later versions of
 vncserver (> 3.3.3r2) support a new automatic encoding that should be equally
 good as the tightvnc encoding.
 .
 Note: This server does not support or need a display. You need a vncviewer to
 see something. However, this viewer may also be on a computer running other
 operating systems in the local net.

Description: global hotkey daemon for Linux
 Triggerhappy watches connected input devices for certain key presses
 or other input events and runs administrator-configured
 commands when they occur. Unlike other hotkey daemons, it runs as a
 persistent, systemwide service and therefore can be used even
 outside the context of a user or X11 session.
 .
 It can handle a wide variety of devices (keyboards, joysticks,
 wiimote, etc.), as long as they are presented by the kernel as
 generic input devices. No kernel patch is required. The daemon is
 a userspace program that polls the /dev/input/event? interfaces
 for incoming key, button and switch events. A single daemon can
 monitor multiple input devices and can dynamically add additional
 ones. Hotkey handlers can be assigned to dedicated (tagged) devices
 or globally.
 .
 For example, this package might be useful on a headless system to
 use input events generated by a remote control to control an
 mpd server, but can also be used to allow the adjustment of audio
 and network status on a notebook without relying on user specific
 configuration.
 .
 Key combinations are supported as well as the hotplugging of devices
 using a udev hotplug script; the running daemon can also be influenced
 by a client program, e.g. to temporarily pause the processing of
 events or switch to a different set of hotkey bindings.

Description: Update Configuration File(s): preserve user changes to config files
 Debian policy mandates that user changes to configuration files must be
 preserved during package upgrades. The easy way to achieve this behavior
 is to make the configuration file a 'conffile', in which case dpkg
 handles the file specially during upgrades, prompting the user as
 needed.
 .
 This is appropriate only if it is possible to distribute a default
 version that will work for most installations, although some system
 administrators may choose to modify it. This implies that the
 default version will be part of the package distribution, and must
 not be modified by the maintainer scripts during installation (or at
 any other time).
 .
 This script attempts to provide conffile-like handling for files that
 may not be labelled conffiles, and are not shipped in a Debian package,
 but handled by the postinst instead. This script allows one to
 maintain files in /etc, preserving user changes and in general
 offering the same facilities while upgrading that dpkg normally
 provides for 'conffiles'.
 .
 Additionally, this script provides facilities for transitioning a
 file that had not been provided with conffile-like protection to come
 under this schema, and attempts to minimize questions asked at
 installation time. Indeed, the transitioning facility is better than the
 one offered by dpkg while transitioning a file from a non-conffile to
 conffile status.

Description: mode switching tool for controlling "flip flop" USB devices
 Several new USB devices have their proprietary Windows drivers onboard,
 especially WAN dongles. When plugged in for the first time, they act
 like a flash storage and start installing the driver from there. If
 the driver is already installed, the storage device vanishes and
 a new device, such as an USB modem, shows up. This is called the
 "ZeroCD" feature.
 .
 On Debian, this is not needed, since the driver is included as a
 Linux kernel module, such as "usbserial". However, the device still
 shows up as "usb-storage" by default. usb-modeswitch solves that
 issue by sending the command which actually performs the switching
 of the device from "usb-storage" to "usbserial".
 .
 This package contains the binaries and the brother scripts.

Description: Universally Unique Identifier Command-Line Tool
 OSSP uuid is an ISO-C and Perl application programming interface (API)
 and corresponding command line interface (CLI) for the generation of
 DCE 1.1 and ISO/IEC 11578:1996 compliant Universally Unique Identifier
 (UUID). It supports DCE 1.1 variant UUIDs of version 1 (time and node
 based), version 3 (name based) and version 4 (random number based).
 .
 UUIDs are 128 bit numbers which are intended to have a high likelihood
 of uniqueness over space and time and are computationally difficult
 to guess. They are globally unique identifiers which can be locally
 generated without contacting a global registration authority. UUIDs
 are intended as unique identifiers for both mass tagging objects
 with an extremely short lifetime and to reliably identifying very
 persistent objects across a network.
 .
 This package contains the Universally Unique Identifier Command-Line Tool.

Description: retrieves files from the web
 Wget is a network utility to retrieve files from the web
 using HTTP(S) and FTP, the two most widely used internet
 protocols. It works non-interactively, so it will work in
 the background, after having logged off. The program supports
 recursive retrieval of web-authoring pages as well as FTP
 sites -- you can use Wget to make mirrors of archives and
 home pages or to travel the web like a WWW robot.
 .
 Wget works particularly well with slow or unstable connections
 by continuing to retrieve a document until the document is fully
 downloaded. Re-getting files from where it left off works on
 servers (both HTTP and FTP) that support it. Both HTTP and FTP
 retrievals can be time stamped, so Wget can see if the remote
 file has changed since the last retrieval and automatically
 retrieve the new version if it has.
 .
 Wget supports proxy servers; this can lighten the network load,
 speed up retrieval, and provide access behind firewalls.

Description: X Window System (X.Org) infrastructure
 x11-common contains the filesystem infrastructure required for further
 installation of the X Window System in any configuration; it does not
 provide a full installation of clients, servers, libraries, and utilities
 required to run the X Window System.
 .
 A number of terms are used to refer to the X Window System, including "X",
 "X Version 11", "X11", "X11R6", and "X11R7".  The version of X used in
 Debian is derived from the version released by the X.Org Foundation, and
 is thus often also referred to as "X.Org".  All of the preceding quoted
 terms are functionally interchangeable in an Debian system.

Description: filtering D-Bus proxy
 xdg-dbus-proxy is a filtering proxy for D-Bus connections. It was
 originally part of the Flatpak project, but it has been broken out as
 a standalone module to facilitate using it in other contexts, for
 example in WebKit-GTK's optional bubblewrap-based sandbox.
 .
 For this proxy to be useful, restricted D-Bus clients must be denied
 access to the normal D-Bus socket (for example by using containers or
 AppArmor rules), and instead given access to the listening Unix socket
 created by the proxy (typically by bind-mounting it into a Linux
 container).

Description: tool to manage well known user directories
 xdg-user-dirs is a tool to help manage "well known" user directories
 like the desktop folder and the music folder. It also handles
 localization (i.e. translation) of the filenames.
 .
 The way it works is that xdg-user-dirs-update is run very early in the
 login phase. This program reads a configuration file, and a set of
 default directories. It then creates localized versions of these
 directories in the users home directory and sets up a config file in
 $(XDG_CONFIG_HOME)/user-dirs.dirs (XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to
 ~/.config) that applications can read to find these directories.

Description: Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) server
 xrdp offers a graphical login to a remote client using
 RDP (the Remote Desktop Protocol). xrdp can connect to
 a locally created X.org session with the xorgxrdp drivers,
 to a VNC X11 server, and forward to another RDP server.
 .
 xrdp accepts connections from freerdp, rdesktop, and the
 built-in terminal server / remote desktop clients of
 Microsoft Windows operating systems.
 In the xorgxrdp (which replaces X11RDP) and VNC modes,
 it provides a fully functional Linux terminal server,
 offering an X-Window desktop to the user. In the RDP
 or VNC forwarding mode, any sort of desktop can be used.

Description: XZ-format compression utilities
 XZ is the successor to the Lempel-Ziv/Markov-chain Algorithm
 compression format, which provides memory-hungry but powerful
 compression (often better than bzip2) and fast, easy decompression.
 .
 This package provides the command line tools for working with XZ
 compression, including xz, unxz, xzcat, xzgrep, and so on. They can
 also handle the older LZMA format, and if invoked via appropriate
 symlinks will emulate the behavior of the commands in the lzma
 package.
 .
 The XZ format is similar to the older LZMA format but includes some
 improvements for general use:
 .
  * 'file' magic for detecting XZ files;
  * crc64 data integrity check;
  * limited random-access reading support;
  * improved support for multithreading (not used in xz-utils);
  * support for flushing the encoder.
